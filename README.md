# zapi
The easiest API service ever.

A PHP API framework that connects to your database out of your box, for easy setup.

The idea of this project came after years of building CMS's and API's in PHP. This is my attempt to make a framework to 
make creating your API service as quick and easy as possible, with as little guesswork as possible.

ZAPI is based on:

- SILEX framework
- ELOQUENT ORM

My abstractions of these libraries will hopefully make them easy to use and quick to deploy.
